CLI commands can request options/arguments from this dictionary by having them as keyword only arguments to their <code>run</code> method.

However, writing unit tests for CLI commands can be especially tricky because much of what CLI commands do is glue together behavior from other objects and emit output. Before unit testing a CLI command a developer should ask the following:</p> <ol> <li>Can this behavior and corresponding unit test be pushed down to the object being operated on or a new function? For example, suppose that <code>flepimop2 hello</code> worked with the <code>RunMeta</code> object and formatted the timestamp for display. In this case the formatting behavior should be added to the <code>RunMeta</code> object and tested there instead of testing that behavior via <code>HelloCommand</code>.</li> <li>Is the behavior essential to the CLI command? For example, the output logged to the user is non-essential. <code>flepimop2</code> does not make guarantees about CLI output consistency across versions. The only case where one might want to test the logged output is to see if a particular branch was reached, i.e. a certain message is only emitted if certain conditions are met.</li> </ol> <p>With that being said, the <code>flepimop2 hello</code> command does not have behavior that would be worth unit testing. For the purposes of unit testing change the <code>HelloCommand.run</code> method to:</p> <pre><code>...\n    def run(self, *, times: int, dry_run: bool) -&gt; None:  # type: ignore[override]\n        \"\"\"\n        Say hello a specified number of times.\n\n        Args:\n            times: The number of times to say hello.\n            dry_run: Whether dry run mode is enabled.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If `times` is greater than 10.\n        \"\"\"\n        if times &gt; 10:\n            msg = \"Cannot say hello more than 10 times.\"\n            raise ValueError(msg)\n        if dry_run:\n            self.info(f\"Would said hello {times} time(s).\")\n            return\n        for i in range(times):\n            self.info(f\"({i + 1}/{times}) Hello, world!\")\n</code></pre> <p>Now the command has behavior, raising an exception, that is worth testing and cannot be pushed to the object being operated on or an external function. To unit test this behavior add the following to <code>tests/_cli/test_hello_command.py</code>:</p> <pre><code>\"\"\"Unit tests for the `flepimop2 hello` CLI command.\"\"\"\n\nfrom flepimop2._cli._hello_command import HelloCommand\nimport pytest\n\n\ndef test_raises_value_error_if_times_exceeds_limit() -&gt; None:\n    \"\"\"Test that ValueError is raised if times &gt; 10.\"\"\"\n    command = HelloCommand()\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=r\"Cannot say hello more than 10 times.\"):\n        command.run(times=11, dry_run=False)\n</code></pre> <p>Another benefit to <code>flepimop2</code>'s CLI infrastructure is that the <code>run</code> method of a <code>CliCommand</code> subclass can be tested directly rather than needing to use <code>subprocess.run</code> or <code>click.testing.CliRunner</code>.
